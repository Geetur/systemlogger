This is a Windows 11 program that I developed as an intern for Outback Construnction Inc.'s IT Department. 
The reason I created it was because I wanted to streamline the troubleshooting process for said department by having an objective source of truth
for the oh-so-common "slow computer" errors that we kept recieving internally. The logic is that 99% of "slow computer" errors are a result of system
resources being over-used, mismanaged, or the like, but it's tough to diagnose exactly what resource is being, say, over-used, and it's also tough to diagnose what 
specific application was the culprit of said resource mismanagement after the fact, so to speak, especially for a non-technical person wherein most of our internal teams were.

Thus, systemlogger was born. Systemlogger tracks the systems resources (just CPU and RAM because all internal computers are equipped with fast SSDs and a reliable, quick internet connection)
and whenever a resource spike occurs, logs the processes associated with that spike. This allows the IT department to very quickly diagnose if the problem was resource misuse,
and if so, what programs were associated with that misuse. AI is also leveraged to give a quick summary and notes of suggestion for what the user could do to avoid the spike in the future.

Overall, systemlogger streamlined the diagnoses of many computer issues because it served as a reliable source of truth for IT department employees. 

This is an example of a project where I owned the end-to-end development of a relevant, specific tool (C# for win 11 desktop) to increase the producticity of a specific team, to overall increase
revenue of the company.
